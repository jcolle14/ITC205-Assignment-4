Hypothesis: The bug is in the roomNumberEntered function
Test: check the parameters
Prediction: The parameters should work
    selection == d, roomId == 101, state = state.ACCEPT, Type = v, number = 1, ccv = 1, selection = r, roomId = 101, serviceType = s, cost = 25
	Executing function should throw exception
Result: 
    Parameters are all the same
	Exception thrown by the function
    Hypothesis confirmed
