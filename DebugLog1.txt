Hypothesis 1: The bug is in the roomIdEntered function
Test: check the parameters
Prediction: The parameters should work
    selection == d, roomId == 101
	Executing function should throw exception
Result: 
    Parameters are both the sane
	Exception thrown by the function
    Hypothesis confirmed

Hypothesis 2: the exception is thrown before line 83 in CheckoutCTL
Test: set a breakpoint at line 83
Prediction: should never get to line 83
Result:
    line 83 not reached
	Hypothesis confirmed
	
Hypothesis 3: the exception is thrown before line 45 in CheckoutCTL
Test: set a breakpoint at line 45
Prediction: should never get to line 45
Result:
    line 45 is reached
	Hypothesis is incorrect
	
Hypothesis 4: the exception is thrown before line 51 in CheckoutCTL
Test: set a breakpoint at line 51
Prediction: should never reach line 51
Result:
    line 51 is reached
	Hypothesis is incorrect
	
Hypothesis 5: the exception is thrown at line 67 in CheckoutCTL
Test: set a breakpoint at line 67
Prediction: should stop at breakpoint
Result:
    stops at breakpoint
	Hypothesis is correct
	
Hypothesis 6: origin of line 67 is sane
              total should be set to 5 at line 66 in CheckoutCTL
Test: inspect total after line 66 executed
Prediction: total is 0
Result:
    total == 0
    Hypothesis is correct
 
    Bug is on line 66

Hypothesis 7: Bug is 5 for total instead of 0
Test: change total to 5	
Prediction: Bug should be fixed, no exceptions
Result: 
    Bug has been fixed
	Hypothesis confirmed
