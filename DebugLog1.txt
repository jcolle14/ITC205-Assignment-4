Hypothesis 1: The bug is in the addServiceCharge function
Test: check the parameters
Prediction: The parameters should work
    selection == d, roomId == 101
	Executing function should throw exception
Result: 
    Parameters are both the sane
	Exception thrown by the function
    Hypothesis confirmed

Hypothesis 2: the exception is thrown before line 146 in Booking
Test: set a breakpoint at line 146
Prediction: should never get to line 146
Result:
    line 146 not reached
	Hypothesis confirmed
	
Hypothesis 3: the exception is thrown before line 131 in Booking
Test: set a breakpoint at line 131
Prediction: should never get to line 131
Result:
    line 131 is reached
	Hypothesis is incorrect
	
Hypothesis 4: the exception is thrown before line 136 in Booking
Test: set a breakpoint at line 136
Prediction: should never reach line 136
Result:
    line 136 is reached
	Hypothesis is incorrect
	
Hypothesis 5: the exception is thrown at line 142 in CheckoutCTL
Test: set a breakpoint at line 142
Prediction: should stop at breakpoint
Result:
    stops at breakpoint
	Hypothesis is correct
	
Hypothesis 6: origin of line 142 is sane
              cost should be changed to "cost" instead of "cosst"
Test: inspect total after line 141 executed
Prediction: double cosst
Result:
    double cosst
    Hypothesis is correct
 
    Bug is on line 141

Hypothesis 7: Bug is cost instead of cosst
Test: change cosst to cost	
Prediction: Bug should be fixed, no exceptions
Result: 
    Bug has been fixed
	Hypothesis confirmed
